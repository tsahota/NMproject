Have you ever tried to continue some model development work (a colleagueâ€™s or even your own) but struggled to remember what was previously done and in which order? Have you ever wished you could repeat your entire model building at the push of a button e.g. because the source data has been updated, or because of a mistake carried forward?

The end-to-end workflows you create with NMproject reduce the time it takes to get a working model, drastically reduce the time to update/repeat prior analyses, enable the repurposing of prior analyses to new problems, and enable pre-programming of complex workflows before data becomes available so that when it does become available we can react to decision points in stats-like timelines.

History: NMproject was previously an internal AstraZeneca project.  It is reimplemented here as a community version.

## Installation

NONMEM, PsN, and Rstudio are required to be installed prior to these steps.  To install the latest development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tsahota/NMproject")
```

To install a specific release (e.g. v0.5.1) use the following command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tsahota/NMproject@v0.5.1")
```

Load the package with 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(NMproject)
```

## Getting started with NMproject

The easiest way to familiarise your with NMproject is to follow through the [demo](https://tsahota.github.io/NMproject/articles/NMproject.html#demo-learn-by-doing-1).

See the [vignette](https://tsahota.github.io/NMproject/articles/NMproject.html) for overall package documentation.

## Example code

NMprojects works best with pipes `%>%`.  Below we take a parent run, `m1`, create a new child run with the first pipe, then convert it from `ADVAN2 TRANS1` (KA, K, V) to `ADVAN2 TRANS2` (KA, CL, V) by piping into the `subroutine()` function before running with the `run_nm()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}

m2 <- m1 %>% child() %>%
  subroutine(trans = 2) %>%
  run_nm()

```

To generate diagnostics we create a diagnostic template with help of pre-existing templates, here it's `Scripts/basic_gof.Rmd` and run this on m2.  This will create a project specific run report to evaluate your model.  Can also run `Scripts/basic_gof.Rmd` interactively as a notebook to customise your diagnostics to the problem.

```{r eval = FALSE}

m2 %>% nm_render("Scripts/basic_gof.Rmd")

## run reports will be in "Results" directory of analysis project

```

Here's a code snippet creating a running simulation so that vpc and ppc diagnostics can be applied
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
m2s <- m2 %>% child(run_id = "m2s") %>%
              update_parameters(m2) %>%
              convert_to_simulation(subpr = 50) %>%
              run_nm()

m2s %>% nm_render("Scripts/basic_vpc.Rmd")
m2s %>% nm_render("Scripts/basic_ppc.Rmd")

## run reports will be in "Results" directory of analysis project

```
