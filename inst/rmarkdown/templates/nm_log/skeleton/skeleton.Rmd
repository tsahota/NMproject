<!-- Instructions: -->
<!--  1. Run this as a notebook -->
<!--  2. make sure you already have data in DerivedData directory -->
<!--  3. Use the code_library() to import code -->
<!--  4. Adapt code below to create a control file suitable for your problem -->
<!--  5. Use the RStudio 'Addins' to help you -->
<!--  6. There are R markdown templates to help you get started with diagnostics -->
<!--  7. Write your thoughts and decision making in the document as you go -->
<!--  8. Keep the script self contained - any R objects your need in other scripts, save them with saveRDS() and use readRDS() to load them in other scripts -->
<!--  9. Rerun chunks whenever you need to restart R and periodically to ensure the reproducibility chain is unbroken -->
<!--  10. after running everything check everything is update with "run all" and then knit the document to have a record of your model development log -->

## REPLACE ME BELOW
## instructions:
##   either use the Addins -> code library to import NONMEM code and then copy-paste the code in the pop up.
##   OR copy a NONMEM model file (and data set) into your analysis project and fill out relative paths below

m1 <- new_nm(run_id = "m1",
             based_on = "relative/path/to/your/NONMEM/file",
             data_path = "relative/path/to/your/NONMEM/ready/file.csv") %>%
  fill_input() %>%
  run_nm()
