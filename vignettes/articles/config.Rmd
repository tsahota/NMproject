```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(NMproject)
```

## Prerequisites

The following need to be installed and available:

- PsN >= 4.4.8
- NONMEM installed with valid license
- RStudio

The following function is recommended as a first step as it first checks for 
availability of PsN via `system_nm()`, this is a requirement for NMproject.

There are also subsequent checks which not mandatory, but recommended for full
functionality.

```{r}
check_installation()
```

You should expect all checks to succeed apart from the code completion setup
check.  It is highly recommended to set up code completion though as it eases
the scripting process.  This is achieved via the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
setup_code_completion()
```
