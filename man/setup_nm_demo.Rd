\description{
Following through the demo is the fastest way to learn the syntax of
NMproject. The default demo is the Theophylline demo "theopp".  Scripts will
be copied numbered s01_XXX.Rmd, s02_XXX.Rmd in the "Scripts" directory and a
dataset into "SourceData". The "staging" area will also be pre-filled with
the code library model, "ADVAN2.mod".  To practice copying this yourself, see
\code{\link{code_library}} for how the app works.
